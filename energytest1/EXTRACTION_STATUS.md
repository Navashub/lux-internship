# Data Extraction Status Report

## Current Situation

### ✓ What We Have:
- **File**: `africa_energy_complete_20251006_202004.csv`
- **Total rows**: 756
- **Countries covered**: All 54 African countries
- **Data type**: Mostly project financing and investment data

### ⚠️ What's Missing:
The extracted data contains **project financing information** (AfDB projects, commitments, etc.) but **NOT the historical energy metrics** we need:
- Electricity access rates (National/Urban/Rural) for 2000-2022
- Electricity generation data across years
- Capacity installations over time
- Renewable energy metrics
- Clean cooking access trends

## The Challenge

The Africa Energy Portal has two types of data:
1. **Project/Investment Data** (what we extracted) - Static tables
2. **Historical Energy Metrics** (what we need) - Dynamic charts/visualizations

The historical data is loaded dynamically via JavaScript charts (Highcharts) and is NOT in simple HTML tables. This requires a different extraction approach.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use API/Direct Data Source (BEST)
The portal likely gets its data from World Bank or IEA databases. We could:
- Extract directly from World Bank API (https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country)
- Use IEA data sources
- This would give us complete, reliable historical data

### Option 2: Extract from Chart Data
- Inspect the JavaScript chart objects on country pages
- Extract the underlying data series from Highcharts configurations
- More complex but would get the exact portal data

### Option 3: Use Database Page with Year Iterations
- Systematically loop through database page
- Change year filters programmatically
- Extract data for each year 2000-2022
- Combine all extractions

### Option 4: Manual Download (if available)
- Check if portal offers bulk data downloads
- Look for CSV/Excel export options

## Required Data Schema (Reminder)

```
["country", "country_serial", "metric", "unit", "sector", "sub_sector", 
 "sub_sub_sector", "source_link", "source", "2000", "2001", ..., "2024"]
```

Each row should be: One metric per country with values for all years 2000-2022.

## Recommended Next Step

**I recommend Option 1**: Extract from World Bank API or similar authoritative source, as:
- ✓ More reliable and complete data
- ✓ Easier to extract programmatically
- ✓ Properly structured with years
- ✓ Same underlying data the portal uses

Would you like me to:
1. Try extracting from World Bank/IEA APIs?
2. Attempt chart data extraction from the portal?
3. Work with current data and transform it?
4. Try a different approach?
